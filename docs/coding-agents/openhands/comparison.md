# OpenHands Comparison Notes

Highlights when comparing OpenHands to other agents in this repo.

- Surface: CLI/Web/IDE clients with both V0 and V1 entrypoints.
- Runtime: V1 app server fronts external SDK/tools; V0 loop remains for legacy.
- Execution: dedicated runtime client + sandbox service for actions.

See `../../comparison/summary.md` for a cross-project snapshot.
