# OpenCode Comparison Notes

Highlights when comparing OpenCode to other agents in this repo.

- Surface: multi-client architecture (CLI, SDK, desktop, web) over one API.
- Runtime: server owns sessions, message parts, and streaming orchestration.
- Tooling: registry merges built-ins, plugins, config tools, and MCP.

See `../../comparison/summary.md` for a cross-project snapshot.
