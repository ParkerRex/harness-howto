# Eigent Key Patterns

- Electron UI spawns a local FastAPI backend and streams SSE steps to the
  renderer.
- Backend and optional server components are split for local vs shared storage.
- Toolkits are modular utilities invoked by the backend runtime.
- Browser automation is encapsulated in a hybrid browser toolkit.
