# Claude Code Open Comparison Notes

Highlights when comparing Claude Code Open to other agents in this repo.

- Surface: local CLI/TUI (Ink) rather than IDE or web-first UI.
- Tool safety: explicit permission modes plus sandboxing and hook-based gating.
- Persistence: JSON sessions + summaries + memory stored under `~/.claude`.

See `../../comparison/summary.md` for a cross-project snapshot.
