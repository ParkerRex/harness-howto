# Gemini CLI Comparison Notes

Highlights when comparing Gemini CLI to other agents in this repo.

- Surface: CLI UX backed by a shared core package.
- Tool safety: policy engine + confirmation bus gate executions.
- Persistence: local sessions, settings, and memory under `~/.gemini` with
  tool checkpoints.

See `../../comparison/summary.md` for a cross-project snapshot.
