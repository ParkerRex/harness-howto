# Eigent Comparison Notes

Highlights when comparing Eigent to other agents in this repo.

- Surface: desktop Electron application rather than CLI or IDE extension.
- Runtime: local FastAPI backend streaming SSE steps to the UI.
- Persistence/sharing: optional server component backed by a SQL database.

See `../../comparison/summary.md` for a cross-project snapshot.
